## Running the Project:

Requirements:
1.Virtual Box
2.Vagrant
3.Bash terminal(for windows machine)


Installation:

1. If you are using a Mac or Linux system, your regular terminal program will do just fine.On Windows, 
use the Git Bash terminal that comes with the Git software.
If you don't already have Git installed, download Git from git-scm.com. 

2.VirtualBox is the software that actually runs the virtual machine. You can download it from virtualbox.org, [here]. 
Install the platform package for your operating system. You do not need the extension pack or the SDK. You do not need 
to launch VirtualBox after installing it; Vagrant will do that.

Note to Ubuntu users:
If you are running Ubuntu 14.04, install VirtualBox using the Ubuntu Software Center instead.
Due to a reported bug, installing VirtualBox from the site may uninstall other software you need.

3.Vagrant is the software that configures the VM and lets you share files between your host computer 
and the VM's filesystem. Download it from vagrantup.com. Install the version for your operating system.

Windows users: The Installer may ask you to grant network permissions to Vagrant or make a firewall exception. Be sure to allow this.


4.You can download and unzip this file:(here) [FSND-Virtual-Machine.zip](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/June/5948287e_fsnd-virtual-machine/fsnd-virtual-machine.zip]
This will give you a directory called FSND-Virtual-Machine. 
It may be located inside your Downloads folder.Alternately, you can use Github to fork and 
clone the repository https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm.Either way, 
you will end up with a new directory containing the VM files. Change to this directory in your terminal with cd.
Inside, you will find another directory called vagrant. Change directory to the vagrant directory:
